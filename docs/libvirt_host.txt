Building and using a libvirt host


Install the right packages
  Void Linux:
    libvirt
    qemu
    virtlogd
    virtlockd

If you are just getting started
  Void Linux:
    virt-manager


Ensure the host has a virtual bridge, often virbr0

Set the VMs to use the same lan as the virtual bridge
  Either DHCP or static IP
